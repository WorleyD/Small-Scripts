# Small-Scripts
A tiny collection of problems, largely Kattis and similar competitive programming style problems

This is not an exhaustive list of problems I've finished, but the solutions to most others were not saved.
I prefer python for its easy input handling and solid standard library, but will use C for programs where speed is necessary.
